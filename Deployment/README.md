# README:

README must include specific metadata to be discoverable by Samples Browser. Here’s a [guide](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/samples/process/onboarding?branch=master) explaining the necessary steps in greater detail.

Aside from the metadata, the README should include the following pieces of information to stay consistent with the rest of the docs
* Description of the project – what project is about, what they’ll find, any other necessary information
* How to run the code
* Related links – any links that you find are related and important to share
* System Requirement – minimal set of information to convey that this is reunion and where to go for more details (maybe included in related links)
