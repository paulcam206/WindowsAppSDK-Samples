# Optical Size

This example demonstrates the optical size axis (`opsz`).

The three columns at right show the same text at the same range of sizes, all in the
Sitka font family.

In the first column, the sample has called `SetAutomaticFontAxes` on the text layout
object, specifying that it should set the `opsz` axis value automatically based on 
the font size.

In the second and third columns, the sample has explicitly set the `opsz` axis value.
This means only the first line of the second column and the last line of the third
column have the *correct* optical size.
